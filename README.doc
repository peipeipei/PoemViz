CLARIFICATION
We have four types of layers: 'rhyme', 'syllable', 'bold', and 'typing'.'Rhyme' is the highlighting layer, 
and shows up as a layer with title "Sound." 'Syllable' is the syllable marks layer, and shows up as a layer
with title "Syllable." 'Bold' is the bolding/font-color layer, and shows up as a layer with title "Words."
'Typing' is the layer with name "Text Options" and allows the user to turn the text off (so as to only 
see their annotations) and insert line breaks/automatically seperate the text by punctutation (partially
implemented).


NEXT STEPS
FROM MEETING WITH CLIENT
Number the lines of the poem so users can talk about the poem more easily. Decide what to do with these
numbers when the user makes new line breaks.

Currently, the syllables are split by syllable breaks (spans) WHEN 'Grid' is clicked.
You might want to change it so that it splits (i.e. creates spans) when clicked, AND is 
remembered in a collection. That way, you can stress by syllable.

Delete pop-up and implement own version of shoutkey so multiple users can play around with the same poem.

In the text options ('typing') layer, have "Line Breaks: button("original") button("punctuation") button("sentence")
Allow the users to (either individually or globally) toggle between these options.
With these new breaks, keep the line, word, letter, and space spans the same, just insert <br>'s or 
put lines by each other. Ultimately, users with still be highlighting original lines/words/letters.

Create a new layer called "writing" where the user can rewrite lines (maybe with contenteditable div),
change the order of words, and insert their own line breaks.

Make it clear that the bolded blue numbers at the right of lines are syllable counts. 
Maybe create a label.

"Clear all syllable marks" button should be made less easy to accidentally click (smaller, maybe X).

In syllable grid, there should be a hyphen after syllable split (me-    |te-    |or)


FROM FINAL PRESENTATION
Have default color for bolding like there is for highlighting 
(so user doesn't have to click on square to start bolding)

“Click to name this layer” would be more intuitive if there were a dotted line border or 
textbox-looking thing around that text so that it looks editable. 

Rename opacity/make it a drop down menu? Have a way for all users to see which opacity is selected 
for a particular layer?

New layers have new set of colors?

Have a way to distinguish between individual and global features

Have set of instructions?

Create a concept of users--- anonymous animals? all cursors visible? something to alert people that they
aren't accidentally making changes themselves




BUGS/NECESSARY CHANGES
Don't add to Selections unless necessary fields are there (i.e. user shouldn't be added weird things 
to collections when clicking without purpose of highlighting/bolding/etc.)

Shouldn't be able to add syllable mark to beginning of word

Layers shouldn't look unclickable... have them all the dark gray and the selected layer should be 
highlighted blue

When visibility of syllables is toggled, the syllable red marks don't come back

Don't display syllable count for blank lines (syllable count should never say "0")

Stress should only affect syllables, not words/letters

Color labels should be global

Allow poems to have a title and an author
