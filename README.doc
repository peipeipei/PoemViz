CLARIFICATION
We have four types of layers: 'rhyme', 'syllable', 'bold', and 'typing'.'Rhyme' is the highlighting layer, 
and shows up as a layer with title "Sound." 'Syllable' is the syllable marks layer, and shows up as a layer
with title "Syllable." 'Bold' is the bolding/font-color layer, and shows up as a layer with title "Words."
'Typing' is the layer with name "Text Options" and allows the user to turn the text off (so as to only 
see their annotations) and insert line breaks/automatically seperate the text by punctutation (partially
implemented).

FOR USERS* (Include in final)
Sorting the poem by all punctuation marks or all sentence punctuation only checks for this punctuation at the ends of words.

Shoutkey (what's after the poemviz.meteor.com/ in the pop-up message after you create the poem) expires after an hour, but the poem will permantly remain at the unique url the shoutkey redirects to (what's after the poemviz.meteor.com/ in the url bar above the created poem).


DESIGN ISSUES
Allow poems to have a title and an author

Number the lines of the poem so users can talk about the poem more easily. Decide what to do with these
numbers when the user makes new line breaks.

"Clear all syllable marks" button should be made less easy to accidentally click (smaller, maybe X).

Make it clear that the bolded blue numbers at the right of lines are syllable counts. 
Maybe create a label.

In syllable grid, there should be a hyphen after syllable split (me-    |te-    |or)

“Click to name this layer” would be more intuitive if there were a dotted line border or 
textbox-looking thing around that text so that it looks editable. 

Have remove all for stress marks?


FEATURE ISSUES
In the text options ('typing') layer, have "Line Breaks: button("original") button("punctuation") button("sentence")
Allow the users to (either individually or globally) toggle between these options.
With these new breaks, keep the line, word, letter, and space spans the same, just insert <br>'s or 
put lines by each other. Ultimately, users with still be highlighting original lines/words/letters.

Create a new layer called "writing" where the user can rewrite lines (maybe with contenteditable div),
change the order of words, and insert their own line breaks.

Have set of instructions?

New layers have new set of colors?



EXTRAS!
Delete pop-up and implement own version of shoutkey so multiple users can play around with the same poem.

Create a concept of users--- anonymous animals? all cursors visible? something to alert people that they
aren't accidentally making changes themselves



METEOR ISSUES
Don't add to Selections unless necessary fields are there (i.e. user shouldn't be added weird things 
to collections when clicking without purpose of highlighting/bolding/etc.)

Rarely, red syllable mark other person made doesn't show up (?)

Stress should only affect syllables, not words/letters
Currently, the syllables are split by syllable breaks (spans) WHEN 'Grid' is clicked.
You might want to change it so that it splits (i.e. creates spans) when clicked, AND is 
remembered in a collection. That way, you can stress by syllable.
...or just locate nearest syllableStyle...

Color labels should be global

Rename opacity/make it a drop down menu? Have a way for all users to see which opacity is selected 
for a particular layer? General: have a way to distinguish between individual and global features
